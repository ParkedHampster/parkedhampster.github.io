# I suck with money.

## No, Really.

<hr />

When I first got out of college, I managed to
land a job paying me $25/hr with $0/yr in bills.

I was working full time and even a little bit over.

After taxes, I was bringing home close to $700
every week. I was incredibly lucky and had a lot
of opportunity ahead of me.

It would be reasonable, then, for someone to ask
me something like "How much money did you put up?"

My honest answer would be $0. I spent every single
dime of it. Magic: the Gathering, a new car, eating
out every day, every dime that hit my bank account
was out of it in a month.

It shouldn't be surprising for me to say that I
never really learned how to save money or invest
or anything.

Through some stroke of luck, I managed to talk
a friend of mine into getting a house well under
market value and have been paying basically pennies
for it. It's not a stretch to say I have received
effectively _*NO*_ punishment for my complete
financial irresponsibility. My luck won't last
forever though, and I know that at a very deep
level.

## _How am I not homeless???_

<hr />

Great question.

No idea.

But I realized, while trying to scrap together
money to replace my tires after one started
falling apart on me and somehow didn't explode
(again, lucky) - I'm not immune to financial
struggles.

I needed to get something together or I was going
to blow up my car and be stranded somewhere.

I tried budgetting and planning my finances so
many times and I constantly just started spending
outside of my budget limits.

Somehow I never really missed a payment but I was
always riddled with fear that I was going to miss
something. My anxiety was the only thing keeping
me housed. Not an acceptable safety net.

In order to afford therapy, have a safety net,
eat on occasion, and keep my house payment in
check, I had to develop a plan.

## The Plan

<hr/>
ADP (and probably most other payment systems)
has a way to go in and declare what bank accounts
your money should go to. Accounts. Plural.

It was time to make my money idiot-proof.
Anything less and I would screw it up and die.

Here's the concept:

I can set up multiple bank accounts for
different types of payments with different
types of access.

<details>
  <summary><strong> &nbsp; The bank accounts:</strong></summary>

<ol start='1'>
<li>
<details>
 <summary>Major payments</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>House</li>
        <li>Car</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
        <li>Insurance</li>
        <li>No debit card</li>
    </ul>
</details>
</li></ol>

<ol start='2'>
<li>
<details>
 <summary>Minor payments</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Spotify</li>
        <li>YouTube Premium</li>
        <li>Hulu</li>
        <li>Debit card that I avoid using at all costs.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
</li></ol>

<ol start='3'>
<li>
<details>
 <summary>Untouchable savings</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>No card. At all.</li>
        <li>No way to transfer without going in.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
</li></ol>

<ol start='4'>
<li>
<details>
 <summary>Sort-of savings</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>Not actually savings. This is just for my
    enjoyment.</li>
    <li>Card that I can use basically freely.</li>
    <li>This account is specifically making mid-size
    purchases and luxury items. Think my previous
    Magic problem from earlier.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
</li></ol>

<ol start='5'>
<li>
<details>
 <summary>My regular account.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily access card.</li>
        <li>This is for food, gas, and general daily living
        expenses.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
</li></ol>

</details>

Additionally, my primary bank account has an
option to automatically round up any purchase
I make and deposit it directly into a savings
account. I have direct access to this and can
immediately transfer it into my main account,
but it's nice being able to look and see that
I've managed to save change into $50 when I
need it.

A few notes I had to keep in mind:
- I got paid every other week.
- All of my bills were already on auto-pay.
- Any payments that _weren't_ on auto-pay, I
put on auto-pay.

Step One:
> Calculate _*ALL*_ of my payment amounts and
frequencies.  
> e.g. My car payment was $317.36 per month.  
> My house taxes were ~$600 twice a year.

Once all of those are calculated...  
Step Two:
> convert that timeline to my pay frequencies.  
> e.g. if my car is ~$320 per month, if I put
aside $160 every two weeks (my pay frequency),
it would cover that cost.  
> (with some change, always round up here.)

Step Three:
> Re-organize my accounts  
> I opened new accounts at my banks and
> had cards added or removed as needed.  
> All of my subscriptions go into my minor
> payments account, major stuff to major, etc.  
> I kept my local bank here because my main
> bank is an online bank that doesn't
> support multiple regular/checking
> accounts.
