# I need to read a thing :""

paper somewhat older (2016)  
can still be interesting to look into  
some of the same issues are still faced  
some of the processes have changed

------

# 1 - Intro

- IT can be better integrated
- Big Data is promising
- New storage methods are more efficient
- already in use in other fields
  - adoption rate has been slow
- study other possibly related fiesds?

------

# 2 - Background

## past and present

- "Big Data" first used in 1997
  - Michael Cox, David Ellsworth
    - paper presented at IEEE
- 2001-2008 - real beginnings of big data as a large
field
  - 3Vs
    - Volume
    - Velocity
    - Variety
  - New storage and data methods
    - XML
    - Hadoop
  - Hospitals start to digitize
- 2009
  - Shift to unstructured data
  - Health data reaches 150EB
    <sup>(~150,000,000,000GB)</sup>
  - cloud environments start to be popular
  - banks, commerce, etc. see process improvements
  - potential is still very young
  - predictive models, simulation not developed
- as of writing
  - cloud computing is becoming the norm

## analytics architecture

- had IT practitioners and academics design best
practice layers

### 1. Data

- required to support daily operations
- data divided into structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data
- collected from internal and external
locations
- stored immediately

### 2. Aggregation

- handle the data
- effectively data cleaning
- data format conversion

### 3. Analytics

- for data processing
- real-time processing and parallel processing
- generally just is analysis

### 4. Information Exploration

- visualization reports
- real-time monitoring
- reporting
- etc

### 5. Data Governance

- Master Data Management
  - application of policies and standards
- Data Lifecycle Management
  - managing business information, archiving,
  maintaining, testing, etc.
  - Concerned with deletion as well
- Data Security and Privacy Management
  - for enterprise-level activities including
  auditing and protection
- layer with the most ethical, legal, and
regulatory concerns.

## Analytics Capability

- is designed around lots of data, health data is a lot
of data
- extremely efficient at what it does

## Conceptualizing benefits

- IT infrastructure
  - business flexibility
  - IT cost reduction
  - increased capabilities

- ops. benefits
  - cost reduction
  - reduced cycle times
  - improved productivity
  - improved quality
  - improved customer service

- managerial benefits
  - better resource management
  - improved decision making
  - improved planning
  - improved performance

- strategic benefits
  - business growth support
  - business alliances support
  - build cost leadership
  - differentiation in products
  - better external linkages

- organizational benefits (this feels like marketing lol)
  - work pattern changes
  - organizational learning facilitation
  - empowerment
  - building common vision
