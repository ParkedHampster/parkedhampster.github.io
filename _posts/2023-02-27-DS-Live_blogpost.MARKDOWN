## $ whoami_

In 2015 I started my professional career with a mostly-undefined IT position.

The department I was working for knew they wanted an intern but really couldn't
figure out what exactly _for_.

After weeks of "**Look busyâ„¢**" and "**Put this into a spreadsheet**," they ran out of
busywork. As my internship came to an end, I had managed to impress a couple
of other departments heads by coding some extremely basic HTML. HR decided that,
no matter how little the IT department had for me to do, they wanted me to stay
**SOMEWHERE**.

At first, I was offered a shot in the robotics department - I'd always been a
fan of robots and any kind of automation so I was extremely hyped on the
opportunity.

The day came for me to start my robotics internship, 8AM sharp!

9Am

10AM

11AM

At 11:30, HR informed me that someone was **FINALLY** coming to get me!

A little late, but I could deal with it.

At last! In walked ...

An engineering manager?

As it turned out, the robotics department had decided against allocating
resources for any interns **that morning**.

I was disappointed that I wouldn't be getting my hands dirty in any PLCs
or risking my hand around any pneumatics, but it all turned out to be a
blessing in disguise.

As it turns out, I had some, albeit minor, engineering experienc. I was able
to help out some of the other starting interns in brainstorming and the tales
of my extremely basic knowledge of vaguely how computers worked sometimes had
made their way throughout the engineering department.

A few of the people were doing some data entry tasks and there was an entire
department for data processing and workshops.

I spent the next several months bouncing between engineering tasks, data
collection, and data processing before I decided that it was unbearable to
read some of the production operators handwriting (mine isn't much better and
I can't really blame them, their hands have enough to do).

I decided it was time to make an entire system from scratch.

Well, mostly scratch.

Our data department had a horrifically optimized Google Sheets page for
every production area. This data was all input manually from one of the
supervisors and then verified by one of the data analysts.

> Man this isn't very efficient, is it

\- me, while holding 5 sheets of paper that are for one week

Enough was enough. I was going to learn JavaScript. And I was going to
use a poorly optimized Google Sheet as a database.

This side project became my magnum opus. I took on responsibility after
responsibility as I added to the functionalities of a site that should
have never existed. For anyone reading that isn't already aware, if you
are ever asked to use Google Sheets as a database - run.

The further, the faster, the better.

I went into that project know absolutely 0 JavaScript. Afterwards, I feel
like I somehow knew less.

There was something I learned a lot about over that process though -
