## Big Data is Coming to Big Pharma

<!-- paper somewhat older (2016)  
can still be interesting to look into  
some of the same issues are still faced  
some of the processes have changed -->

A 2016 study investigated the potential impact of big
data and data modeling on the health care industry,
and, while the paper may be a bit older, the outlooks
can still yield great benefit to us today. Some of the
things mentioned in the study may even be things that
are being implemented as you read this!

## Introduction

<!-- - IT can be better integrated
- Big Data is promising
- New storage methods are more efficient
- already in use in other fields
  - adoption rate has been slow
- study other possibly related fiesds? -->

As of the writing of this research, the Information
Technology field has had a slow start into the medical
field.

As powerful as IT is, integration into the medical
field is all but necessary, and the advancement of Big
Data as an industry is extraordinarily promising.
Especially as storage methods become more efficient and
better in general.

Since IT is so prevalent in other, similar fields, it
seems odd that the medical adoption rate was lagging so
far behind.

It stands to reason that it would be more than worth it
to study other fields for their adoption methods and
efficacy in terms of advancing technology.

## Background

### Big Data, Past and Present

<!-- - "Big Data" first used in 1997
  - Michael Cox, David Ellsworth
    - paper presented at IEEE
- 2001-2008 - real beginnings of big data as a large
field
  - 3Vs
    - Volume
    - Velocity
    - Variety
  - New storage and data methods
    - XML
    - Hadoop
  - Hospitals start to digitize
- 2009
  - Shift to unstructured data
  - Health data reaches 150EB
    <sup>(~150,000,000,000GB)</sup>
  - cloud environments start to be popular
  - banks, commerce, etc. see process improvements
  - potential is still very young
  - predictive models, simulation not developed
- as of writing
  - cloud computing is becoming the norm -->

In terms of terms, "Big Data" has been a phrase since
1997, when it was first used by Michael Cox and David
Ellsworth in a paper presented at IEEE, explaining the
visualization of data and the challenges that computer
systems may encounter because of it.

From 2001 to 2008, Big Data as an industry started to
take shape. Revolving around the 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
and Variety), it was accompanied by advancements in
methods for storing and using data - things like XML
and Hadoop were still new on the scenes.  
Additionally, this is when hospitals started to
digitize their patient records.

2009 saw a shift toward unstructured data as health
data climbed to a staggering _150 exabytes_ - or
_**150,000,000,000 GIGABYTES**_ of data.  
Across industries, cloud environments were starting to
gain traction. Banks, commerce, and a lot of other
industries started seeing process improvements, but the
potential of it all was still very young. Predictive
models and simulation capabilities were still over the
horizon and hadn't been fully developed.

By 2016, the time of the research paper's writing,
cloud computing started to reach a point of normalcy.

### Research Architecture

<!-- - had IT practitioners and academics design best
practice layers -->

In order to make any progress, the research had to have
a structure for its approach. Researchers worked with
various IT practitioners and academics to design a
layered process to determine best practices.

#### 1. Data

<!-- - required to support daily operations
- data divided into structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data
- collected from internal and external
locations
- stored immediately -->

Data is required for operations support. Studies can't
be done if there isn't data. At this layer, data is
split into structured, unstructured, and somewhere
in-between. This data was collected from sources both
internal and external and then was immediately stored.

#### 2. Aggregation

<!-- - handle the data
- effectively data cleaning
- data format conversion -->

Layer 2 is for processing and generally handling the
data from before, effectively cleaning and converting
the data for use in later layers.

#### 3. Analytics

<!-- - for data processing
- real-time processing and parallel processing
- generally just is analysis -->

The third layer is where the bulk of the processing is
handled. Additionally, this is for real-time and
parallel processing. Basically, any kind of analysis is
done at this point.

#### 4. Information Exploration

<!-- - visualization reports
- real-time monitoring
- reporting
- etc -->

The exploration layer is what we would now call EDA,
or exploration data analysis. This is where certain
aspects of the data would be visualized and where
real-time data is monitored, as well as a few other
pieces of explanatory processing.

#### 5. Data Governance

<!-- - Master Data Management
  - application of policies and standards
- Data Lifecycle Management
  - managing business information, archiving,
  maintaining, testing, etc.
  - Concerned with deletion as well
- Data Security and Privacy Management
  - for enterprise-level activities including
  auditing and protection
- layer with the most ethical, legal, and
regulatory concerns. -->

Data governance describes the overall management of the
data at hand, including how policies are applied to
both the input and the output data. Things like
regulation would be observed and managed here.  
The lifecycle of data is also looked at at this point.
How to manage business information, how to archive,
maintain, and test everything, it all falls under data
governance. Related to this is deletion, which is
covered in much the same way.  
This layer is the most concerned with ethical, legal,
and regulatory status. It fully encompasses data
security and privacy.

### Analytics Capability of Big Data

<!-- - is designed around lots of data, health data is a lot
of data
- extremely efficient at what it does -->

Big Data is a concept designed around a lot of data.
Conveniently, a lot of data is what the medical
industry is working with. The field of data analysis is
set up to be extremely efficient at working with this
sort of thing, and therefore has the exact kind of
analytical capability that we're looking for.

### Conceptualizing benefits

There is a lot of potential for benefits when adopting
Big Data methodologies across several pieces of the
industry puzzle.

  - business flexibility
  - IT cost reduction
  - increased capabilities -->

## Reasearch Methods

<!-- - quantitative approach
- multi-case analysis -->

Research done took a quantitative approach to using
multi-case analysis, as described in the following
sections.

### Case collection

<!-- - drawn from current and past data projects
- specific criteria:
  - represents actual big data implementation
  - clearly describes software and benefit
  implementation
- 26 cases related to the healthcare industry
  - kinds:
  - 14 from vendor/company materials
  - 2 from journal databases
  - 10 from print publications
  - regions:
  - 17 from NA
  - 7 from EU and APAC
- phase 1:
  - senior consultant organized the data collected into
  themes
  - 136 IT-related statements
  - 179 benefit-related statements
- phase 2
  - organize phase 1 data through coding
  - create categories and abstract
    - analyze statements by one of the authors and then
    group into conceptual themes
    - ^^ reduce number of categories, collapse similar
    categories into broader ones -->

All cases used were drawn from then-current and past
projects that meet two specific criteria:

- Representative of actual big data implementation
- Clearly describes the benefits and implementation of
software

There were 26 cases that were related to the health
care industry in some way.

- 14 were from vendor or company materials
- 2 were from academic journal databases
- 10 were from print publications

By region, 17 were from North America, 7 were from
Europe, and the remaining 2 were from the Asia-Pacific
region.

### Capability profile

<!-- - categories:
  - analytical/pattern of care (43)
  - unstructured (32)
  - decision support (23)
  - predictive (21)
  - traceability (17) -->

There were 5 general categories of application for Big
Data principles uncovered by the study, as outlined
here:

| Category | Number<br/>of Cases |
| :---: | :---: |
| Analytical/ Pattern of Care | 43 |
| Unstructured | 32 |
| Decision Support | 23 |
| Predictive | 21 |
| Traceability | 17 |

#### Patterns of care

Big data analysis methods provide a broader view for
clinical practice that is evidence-based given the
sheer quantity of medical data that exists. Over
massive amounts of data, seeing and recognizing
consistent needs for care.
