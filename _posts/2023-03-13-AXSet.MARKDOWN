## Using `fig, ax`

Starting off - the imports and dependencies.

We'll be taking a look at matplotlib's pyplot functionality <sup>(plt)</sup>

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

%matplotlib inline # <= Jupyter Notebook's inline display magic command
```

As normal, the plot can be set up with the `fig, ax` declaration commonly
used in matplotlib.

```py
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
```

We'll set a litle bit of example data here to that things make more sense later.

```py
shirts_by_people = {
    "Thomas" : 15,
    "Jane" : 3,
    "Carlos" : 7,
    "Jermaine" : 9,
    "Hayle" : 4
}
```

Normally, setting up the title, labels, and various details would be fairly
verbose, having to be explicit about WHAT is being set in the method call.

```py
ax.set_title("Shirts Per Person")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Shirts")
ax.set_xlabel("Person Name")
```
